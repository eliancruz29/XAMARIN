        <p>15 minutes</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
        In this exercise we will build and run the included <b>Tasky Pro</b> application. If possible, you should try to build both the iOS and Android versions. This will ensure you have your development environment setup properly and prepare you for your Xamarin University education. If you have already succesfully built/compiled a Xamarin application then you can skip this exercise.
        </p>

        <p>
        TaskyPro is a simple cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows you to track todo tasks. It illustrates cross-platform code-sharing for the data and business logic layers and separates out the User Interface and Application Layer into appropriate platform-specific applications.

        This is intended to be a guided exercise with a Xamarin University instructor, however if you are doing this on your own, you can follow the steps below.
        </div>

        <h2>Required assets</h2>
        <p>
            The provided <strong>Part 01 Resources</strong> folder contains a subfolder named <strong>TaskyPro</strong> with the solution you will need to complete this lab exercise. The supplied solution includes C# based projects for iOS, Android and Windows.
        </p>

        <h2>Running the code</h2>
        <p>
        When executing the program, you can test on a real device, or on the emulator / simulator.
        <ul class="indent-medium">
            <li>
            To setup a device, see <a href="http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/device_provisioning/">iOS Device Provisioning</a> and <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/getting_started/installation/set_up_device_for_development/">Setting up your Android Device for Development</a>.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In this exercise, we built and ran a cross-platform Xamarin application and verified that the Xamarin tools are properly installed on your machine. You saw an example project that uses a variety of .NET classes as well as unique iOS and Android features to display and change presented information.</p>
